# Thursday Exercises: TensorFlow and Keras

## Overview

Today's exercises bridge theory to practice with TensorFlow and Keras. The highlight is a **Pair Programming** activity where you collaborate to build neural network architectures.

## Exercises

| Exercise | Type | Duration | Focus |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| 07: Tensor Manipulation Lab | Code Lab | 60 min | TensorFlow operations |
| 08: Sequential Model Builder | **PAIR PROGRAMMING** | 90 min | Collaborative model building |
| 09: Dense Network MNIST | Code Lab | 90 min | End-to-end classification |

## Prerequisites

- Completed readings: `13-17` in `readings/4-Thursday/`
- Watched demos: `demo_07` through `demo_09`
- TensorFlow 2.x installed

## Setup

```bash
cd exercises/4-Thursday
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pair Programming Instructions (Exercise 08)

Exercise 08 is designed for pairs. You will:
- **Driver:** Types the code
- **Navigator:** Designs the architecture and guides implementation
- Switch roles every 15-20 minutes
