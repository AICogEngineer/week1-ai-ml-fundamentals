# Tuesday Exercises: ML Fundamentals

## Overview

These exercises reinforce the statistical learning fundamentals covered in today's readings and demos. You'll implement algorithms from scratch to build deep understanding.

## Exercises

| Exercise | Type | Duration | Focus |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| 01: Regression from Scratch | Code Lab | 90 min | Gradient descent implementation |
| 02: Classifier Comparison | Code Lab | 60 min | Comparing ML algorithms |
| 03: K-Means Customer Segmentation | Code Lab | 90 min | Real-world clustering |

## Prerequisites

- Completed readings: `01-06` in `readings/2-Tuesday/`
- Watched demos: `demo_01` through `demo_03`
- Python environment with NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will be able to:

1. Implement gradient descent for linear regression without libraries
2. Compare and evaluate different classification algorithms
3. Apply clustering to real-world business problems
4. Interpret model outputs and make data-driven decisions

## Getting Started

```bash
cd exercises/2-Tuesday
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start with Exercise 01 and proceed in order.
