# Wednesday Exercises: Neural Network Fundamentals

## Overview

These exercises build intuition for neural networks by implementing core components from scratch. You'll understand what happens inside the "black box."

## Exercises

| Exercise | Type | Duration | Focus |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| 04: Perceptron from Scratch | Code Lab | 90 min | Build perceptron class |
| 05: Activation Analysis | Hybrid Lab | 60 min | Compare activation functions |
| 06: Forward Prop Calculator | Paper + Code | 60 min | Manual calculations |

## Prerequisites

- Completed readings: `07-12` in `readings/3-Wednesday/`
- Watched demos: `demo_04` through `demo_06`
- Python environment with NumPy, matplotlib

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will be able to:

1. Implement a perceptron with forward pass and learning
2. Understand activation function behaviors and trade-offs
3. Manually trace forward propagation through a network
4. Connect theory to implementation

## Getting Started

```bash
cd exercises/3-Wednesday
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
